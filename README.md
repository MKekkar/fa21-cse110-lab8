# Lab 8 - Starter

1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   This way tests are automatically always run every time someone wants to push their code, and 
   that way nobody can try to add code to the codebase without it going through testing.

2. No, I would just use unit tests

3. I would try to break this feature into multiple tests to unit test, if I wanted to test
   the whole thing then I would rather use an end-to-end test as there are many steps taking place.

4. Yes, this is a single feature and can easily be tested in isolation so I would unit test it.
